- Focus on concepts suitable for someone new to Consul or with 1-2 years of experience
- Avoid complex multi-datacenter setups, advanced security configurations, or performance tuning
- Use content found on the official HashiCorp Consul documentation (https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs) and learning platforms (https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/tutorials)

**Quality Standards:**

- Questions should test foundational technical knowledge appropriate for beginners to intermediate users
- Focus on standard command syntax, basic configuration parameters, and common API usage
- Correct answers should include clear technical details and straightforward syntax
- Distractors should be common beginner mistakes, similar-looking commands, or basic configuration errors
- Distractors should test typical misconceptions that new users might have
- Explanations must include clear syntax examples and fundamental implementation concepts
- Each question should teach essential skills needed for basic Consul implementation
- Focus on practical, everyday knowledge rather than edge cases or advanced scenarios
- Ensure questions are appropriate for someone studying for their first Consul certification

**Domain-Specific Focus Areas:**

**IMPORTANT - Post-Generation Validation:**

After generating the JSON, it's critical to validate the output before use:
1. Save the generated JSON to a file with a descriptive name
2. Run validation using: .\Validate-QuizJSON.ps1 -FilePath "your-file.json"
3. Fix any errors or warnings reported by the validation script
4. Re-validate until the script reports "VALIDATION PASSED"

The validation script checks for:
- JSON syntax correctness
- Required field presence and proper data types
- Answer uniqueness and quality
- Content structure and formatting
- Common issues like field naming errors

Generate questions that test specific technical implementation skills, command syntax, and configuration knowledge that a Cloud Engineer needs to successfully deploy and manage Consul in production environments. Prioritize syntax accuracy and functional understanding over abstract scenarios.
