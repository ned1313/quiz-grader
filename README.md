**Content Guidelines:**

- Use current Azure services and features (as of 2025)
- Include specific Azure resource names, settings, and configurations
- Test understanding of service limits, pricing tiers, and architectural decisions
- Cover troubleshooting scenarios and performance optimization
- Include security, compliance, and governance considerations
- Reference real Azure portal workflows and PowerShell/CLI commands

**Quality Standards:**

- Questions should require 2-3 levels of Azure knowledge to answer correctly
- Distractors should be realistic options an inexperienced admin might choose
- Explanations must reference official Microsoft documentation
- Each question should teach something valuable beyond just testing knowledge
- Avoid questions with obvious answers or trick questions

**Domain-Specific Focus Areas:**

**Identity and Governance (15-20%):**

- Azure AD user and group management, RBAC assignments
- Conditional Access policies and MFA configuration
- Azure Policy implementation and compliance monitoring
- Privileged Identity Management and access reviews

**Storage (15-20%):**

- Storage account configuration and security features
- Blob lifecycle management and access tiers
- Azure Files integration and hybrid scenarios
- Backup strategies and disaster recovery

**Compute (20-25%):**

- VM deployment, scaling, and availability options
- Container services and App Service configurations
- Automation scripts and configuration management
- Performance monitoring and troubleshooting

**Networking (25-30%):**

- Virtual network design and subnet planning
- Network security groups and application security groups
- VPN Gateway and ExpressRoute configurations
- Load balancer and Application Gateway scenarios

**Monitoring and Backup (10-15%):**

- Azure Monitor alerting and Log Analytics queries
- Backup policies and recovery scenarios
- Site Recovery planning and testing
- Performance diagnostics and optimization

Generate questions that an experienced Azure administrator would find challenging but fair, reflecting real-world scenarios they encounter in enterprise environments.
```

### Example Usage

Replace placeholders with specific values:

- `[NUMBER]`: 10, 15, 20, etc.
- `[DOMAIN]`: "Identity and Governance", "Storage", etc.
- `[SPECIFIC DOMAIN]`: More detailed focus area
- `[PERCENTAGE]`: Exam weight percentage

### Quality Validation

Before adding generated questions:

1. Verify all reference URLs are valid and current
2. Test questions with the quiz application
3. Ensure explanations are comprehensive and educational
4. Confirm difficulty level matches AZ-104 Associate level
