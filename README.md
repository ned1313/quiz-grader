## üöÄ How to Use the Quiz Application

### Getting Started

1. **Choose a certification folder** (e.g., AZ-104/)
2. **Load a question bank file** into the quiz application
3. **Select Practice or Exam mode** based on your study goals
4. **Complete the quiz** and review results with detailed explanations

### Combining Question Banks

To create larger practice exams combining multiple domains:

```bash
# Example PowerShell script to combine question banks
$questions = @()
$questions += (Get-Content "certification/domain1-questions.json" | ConvertFrom-Json).questions
$questions += (Get-Content "certification/domain2-questions.json" | ConvertFrom-Json).questions
$questions += (Get-Content "certification/domain3-questions.json" | ConvertFrom-Json).questions

$combinedQuiz = @{
    title = "Combined Practice Exam"
    questions = $questions
}

$combinedQuiz | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10 | Out-File "combined-practice-exam.json"
```

## ü§ñ Interactive Prompt Generation

### Quick Start with AI Question Generation

To quickly generate customized AI prompts for your certification:

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
.\Generate-PromptTemplate.ps1
```

**Linux/macOS/WSL (Bash):**

```bash
./generate-prompt-template.sh
```

These interactive scripts will guide you through creating a customized AI prompt based on your specific certification needs. See `PROMPT-GENERATION.md` for detailed usage instructions.

## üìù Question Format

Each question follows this structure:

```json
{
  "question": "Question text here",
  "correct_answer": "The correct answer",
  "wrong_answers": ["Wrong 1", "Wrong 2", "Wrong 3", "Wrong 4"],
  "explanation": "Detailed explanation of why this is correct",
  "references": ["Documentation link", "Study guide reference"],
  "category": "Domain category"
}
```

## üìñ Study Tips

### Effective Study Strategy

1. **Start with domain-specific quizzes** to identify knowledge gaps
2. **Use Practice Mode** to learn from immediate feedback and explanations
3. **Take full practice exams** in Exam Mode to simulate real testing conditions
4. **Review incorrect answers** thoroughly with provided explanations and references
5. **Focus on weak areas** where you score below 70%
6. **Track progress** across multiple study sessions

### General Study Best Practices

- **Hands-on Practice**: Use the actual technology platform being tested
- **Official Documentation**: Follow reference links provided in question explanations
- **Practice Labs**: Complete hands-on exercises for each certification domain
- **Study Groups**: Join certification-specific communities and forums
- **Spaced Repetition**: Review questions multiple times over several weeks

## ü§ñ AI Question Generation Prompt

Use this comprehensive prompt template when generating new certification questions with AI tools:

### Universal Prompt Template

```text
You are an expert [TECHNOLOGY] professional and certification trainer creating high-quality [CERTIFICATION_NAME] practice questions. Generate [NUMBER] challenging questions for the [DOMAIN] domain of the [CERTIFICATION_NAME] certification exam.

**Requirements:**
- Target the [CERTIFICATION_NAME] certification level
- Focus on [SPECIFIC_DOMAIN] which represents [PERCENTAGE]% of the exam
- Create a mix of scenario-based questions that test practical application, and more straightforward questions that test knowledge
- Include real-world situations a [ROLE_TITLE] would encounter
- Ensure questions test deep understanding of [TECHNOLOGY] concepts and best practices

**Question Format (JSON):**
```

```json
{
  "question": "Detailed scenario-based question (2-4 sentences)",
  "correct_answer": "Precise, actionable correct answer",
  "wrong_answers": ["Plausible but incorrect option", "Another realistic distractor", "Common misconception", "Related but wrong approach"],
  "explanation": "Comprehensive explanation (3-5 sentences) covering why the correct answer is right and why others are wrong. Include key concepts and best practices. Also include single sentence explanations of why the distractors were incorrect.",
